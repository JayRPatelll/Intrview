-React is javascript library.
- React is used for building UI.
- React simplifies the creation of single page application by using reusable component.

- single page application have only one single page.
- content is dynamically updated without refreshing or loading a new page.

Advantages of React:
1. Simple to build single page application by using components.\
2. React is cross platform and open source.
3. Lightweight and very fast.
4. Testing is easy.

React and Angular:
1. React is a javascript library.    1. Angular is a framework.
2. React uses a virtual DOM which makes it faster.      2.  Angular uses a real DOM.
3. React is faster than Angular.

DOM (Document object Model) which allows javascript to dynamically access and manipulate the content.

React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI without re-render the entire page,
it only updates an element inside dom, which helps improve performance and make the 
application more responsive.

- React follows component based architecture.

- In React, a component is a reusable building block for 
creating user interfaces.

----folder structure.

NPM and npm_modules folder:
- npm is used to manage the dependencies for your react project, including the react library itself.
- npm_modules folder contains all the dependencies of the project, including React library.

Public folder:
-contains all staic assets.

Src folder:
- all source code of application.

index.html page in React:
- This file is entry point of an application.

App.js file :
- this is top/main/root level component in React application and 
it is responsible for all other component.

In react function is a javascript function that returns react element.

-export default in App.js:
- it is used to make this app component available for import using import statement
in other file.


- index.js file is JS file which renders all the components and replace the root element of index.html file
with the newly rendered root element.s
- ReactDOM is a javascript library which convert your components to the actual browser DOM.
- Render method: 

JSX :

- JavaScript XML is a syntax extention used by react to write HTML like code.

Advantages of JSX:
1. improve code readability
2. error checking in advance (Type safety)
3. Support JavaScript expressions.
4. improved performance.
5. code reusability.

JSX code is converted into JS by Babel library.

map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements
using a callback function.

Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

Types of Components:

1. Functional components : Declared as a javascript function. They are stateless components but with the help of 
 hooks they can now manage state also.

2. Class components : 

How do you pass data between functional components in React ?
- Props are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component.

What is prop drilling ?
- process of passing down props through multiple layers of components. parent compo --> child comp --> grand child comp

why to avoid Prop Drilling?
1. Maintenance : which make code harder to maintain as changes in data flow require updates
across multiple components.
2. complexity: increase code complexity and reduces code readability.
3. debugging : becomes challenging.

Class Components :
- Defined using JavaScript Classes.
- they are stateful components by using lifecycle method.
- render method in a class components is responsible for returning JSX.

How to pass data between class comp ?
- this.props can be used in child component to access data passed from parent component.

this keyword is used to refer to the instance of class.


Differences between functional and class components ?
     functional comp                                                 class comp

1. Defined as JS function.				1. defined as JS class.
2. Stateless but can now maintain state 		2. can manage state with this.state
using hooks.
3. No lifecycle method					3. yes
4. more readable and concise.				4. complex
5. do not have render method 				5. render method

Routing and Router in React ?
- Routing allows you to create a single page web application with navigation,
without the need for a full-page refresh.
- Router is a library for handling routing and enables navigation and rendering of 
different components based on the URL.

command to install router :
- npm install react-router-dom

import {Routes, Route, Link} from "react-router-dom";

<Link to="/about"> About </Link>

<Routes>
	<Route path="/about" element={<About/ >} />
</Routes>

step 1: Install React Router
step 2: Create Navigation
step 3: Create Routes

What are the roles of <Routes> & <Route> in react routing ?
- The <Routes> component is used as the root container fro declaring your 
collection of routes.
- The <Route> component is used to define a route and specify the component
that should render when the route matches.

Route parameter in react router are a way to pass dynamic values
to the component as part of the URL path.

<Route path="/users/:userId" component={UserProfile} />
