1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) creation.
- first create VPC
- create subnet
- configure route table
- you can monitor through CloudWatch.

2. IAM (Identity and Access Management)

3. CodePipeline
- use AWS secret manager to store API keys and password securly.

4. Name some AWS services which is not region specific.
- IAM, Amazon route 53, AWS cloudfront

5. Differences between Amazon EC2 and AWS lambda.
- both are compute services in aws.
- Amazon EC2 provides virtual servers that you manage, while AWS lambda 
  runs code in response to events and scales automatically.
- choose ec2 for long-running tasks or when you need more control over the environment.
example : hosting a website with specific software requirements or running a database server.
- choose lambda for event driven, short-lived task with automatic scaling.
- Example: processing event-driven actions such as file uploads, database updates and API requests.

6. cloudFormation 
- is a service which lets you create resources like ec2, s3, RDS and many. So 
it's an infrastructure as code service.

7. Database sever should be launched into private subnets.
which enhanced security by restricting direct access from the internet.

8. Database services in AWS.
- Document DB - Mongodb compatible.
- DynamoDb - No SQL database 
- ElastiCashe
- RDS -Relationl Databse service.(sql server, mysql)

9. Auto scaling automatically adjust the number of instances in a group based on demand.
It can be implemented in AWS using services like Auto Scaling groups, which dynamically adjust 
capacity to maintain performance and reduce cost.

10. Vertical Scaling : Increasing or decreasing the resources of an instance, such as CPU or RAM.

Horizontal scaling : Increase in number of machines.

11. Different AWS services to manage COST.

Cloud Financial Services -> Billing and Cost Management -> AWS budgets, AWS cost and reports

12. NAT Gateway vs NAT Instances
- NAT Gateway whivh managed by AWS, high performance, and availability, no administration needed.
- NAT Instance is user managed EC2 instances requires manual scaling and administration.

13. Ways to access AWS services.
- AWS management console, AWS command line, SDK, AWS cloudFormation.

14. Different type of load balancer :
- Application Load Balancer : for HTTP/HTTPS traffic and modern web applications with multiple services or APIs.
- Network Load Balancer : for TCP/UDP traffic such as gaming or real time communication.
- Gateway Load Balancer : Routes traffices to virtual private network.

15. How do you allow or restric access to AWS services?
- IAM (Identity and Access Management.)
- NACLs (Network Access Control lists)

16. in AWS instance is called as SERVER.
- AMI (Amazon machine Image)

17. Process of Setting up a CI/CD pipeline in AWS using Codepipeline and CodeBuild.
- the process involves defining stages (source, build, test, deploy)

18. Deploy docker containers using Amazon Elastic Container Services.

19. Your company wants to migrate its on-premises infrastructure to AWS for cost saving and scalibility.
what are the steps. ?
- steps include accesing current infrastructure, selecting migration strategy(lift and shift, replatforming),
estimating costs, planning for data migration, testing, and executing the migration with minimal downtime.
